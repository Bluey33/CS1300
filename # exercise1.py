#1.What happens when you add an integer to a float? 
# you get a float 
#2. Can you multiply a string by a number? What does it do?
#yes it would repeat the string 
#3. What error do you get when trying to add a string to a number?
#you would get a type error you would have to convert the number first in order to add the string to the number.
